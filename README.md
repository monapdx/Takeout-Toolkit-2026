# Takeout Toolkit 🧰  
**Local-first pipelines for cleaning, transforming, and exploring your exported data**

Takeout Toolkit is a modular collection of **Python-based pipelines** for processing data exports from major platforms like **Gmail, Google Search, Facebook, and ChatGPT**.

It is designed for people who want to:
- Own their data
- Work offline
- Avoid cloud lock-in
- Turn raw exports into something **readable, explorable, and human-scale**

This is not a black-box dashboard.  
It is a **toolkit**.

---

## ✨ What This Is

- A set of **scripted pipelines** that transform messy export files into clean, structured outputs
- A **local-first** workflow (no servers, no uploads, no accounts)
- Designed for **archival, analysis, personal knowledge, and creative reuse**
- Built to be **inspectable, hackable, and remixable**

You can run one pipeline or many.  
You can stop at CSVs or launch a local visual explorer.

## 🚫 What This Is Not

- ❌ A hosted SaaS
- ❌ A surveillance or analytics product
- ❌ A single monolithic app
- ❌ A replacement for the original platforms

Your data stays on *your* machine, always.
